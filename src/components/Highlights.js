        <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}> 1. Yerevan: </span> Armenia’s
        capital is sometimes known as the ‘pink city’ because of the colour of
        the stone used to build it. Begining on Republic Square, there’s the
        Opera and Ballet Theatre, Cascade Park, Matenadaran, Armenia’s ancient
        manuscripts library, and the Genocide Memorial. There’s a thriving café
        culture here, and lots of opportunity to try the local drink.

          2. Religious sites and pagan temples:
        </span>{" "}
        Garni was built in the first century and is the only pagan temple
        remaining in the region. Outside, friendly locals sell homemade honey
        and sweets. And there’s Armenian’s answer to Stonehenge, Karahunj,
        dating back to the middle of the Bronze Age. Plus numerous churches and
        monasteries too, some linked dramatically to the natural world around
        them: Geghard Monastery, dating to the 13th century, where on the
        hillside you can still see caves that housed monastic cells; Khor Virap,
        one of the holiest sites in the country, with stunning views of Mount
        Ararat; and Noravank Monastery, a masterpiece of the 13th-century
        architect Momik, located in the twisting canyon. Sevanavank has
        commanding views of Lake Sevan.
      </p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>
        <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>3. Wine production:</span> Wine has
        been produced here for 10,000 years; we visit Areni village, home to the
        finest Armenian wine, for a tasting.{" "}
      </p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>
        <span style={{ fontSize: "bold" }}>4. Echmiadzin:</span> The capital of
        Armenia from 180 to 340 AD, when Christianity was first adopted by the
        Armenian people, is simply stunning. The main cathedral nestles among
        hedges and lawns, where bearded clergy in dark robes sit in theological
        debate. In the gardens there are many fine khachkars (carved
        cross-stones) and bell towers.
      </p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>
        <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>5. The Silk Road:</span> Snaking
        through Europe, Central Asia and all the way to China, travellers have
        been passing this way for millenia. There’s the well-preserved,
        14th-century Selim caravanserai, and we continue to the top of the pass
        where the landscape changes, before descending to the blue waters of
        Lake Sevan. We make a stop at Noraduz to see the ‘forest’ of
        cross-stones that incorporate both pagan and Christian symbols, before
        continuing to the shores of the lake, the largest in the Caucasus and
        landlocked Armenia’s ‘seaside’.
      </p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: "18pz" }}>
        <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>6. Lori:</span> The lush alpine
        region of northern Armenia. We visit Dilijan, a small town known for its
        arts and crafts, and the 12th-century Haghartsin Monastery, which is set
        in a forested valley.
